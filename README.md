Iâ€™m a backend developer turned full stack, learning and growing every day in the digital world one step at a time. My passion lies in building projects from the ground upâ€”starting with simple scripts and evolving into fully functional websites and applications. Along the way, Iâ€™ve been expanding my skills, exploring new tools, and diving deeper into the world of development.
